# Eolo project

### Data analytics and Machine Learning techniques applied to meteorological and wind farm power data

## Overview

This project aims to detect the relation between several types of data features in order to locate where, ideally, would this wind farm be placed. The code in this repository takes meteorological data (GFS) and the power registered for 2 years in a wind farm. We will analyse data meteorological predictions for 6 hours horizon in more than 36 hectares space.

The current project it is under final assesment framwork of the Ironhack academic program for the Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## Data
**Meteorological predictions**
The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a [weather forecast model produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)](ftp://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid points

The data were structured in more than 4K arrays-format-files (.gra) holding information related to these meteorological variables:

On this project, meteorological predictions are the heaviest part of the data wrangling process.


Given meteorological data (GFS) for an area of 37 hectare, aproximetly. Plus, the power generated by the wind farm for over 3 years, .
